Repair: The first step is that the damage must be appropriately fixed. This may range from minor fixes to major structural repairs. The airplane must be restored to its original or properly altered condition that complies with its type design.\\n\\n2. Inspection: After repairs, the aircraft must undergo an extensive inspection by an authorized inspector. They will examine the structural integrity and verify the condition and operation of all systems and components.\\n\\n3. Documentation: All maintenance work, including repairs and inspections, have to be correctly documented following EASA regulations. \\n\\n4. Test Flight: If necessary, the aircraft may need to undergo a test flight after the repairs, following a pre-established test plan that should cover all areas in which the aircraft's performance might have been affected by the damage and its repair.\\n   \\n5. Conformity to Airworthiness Directives (ADs) and Service Bulletins (SBs): It's important that all relevant ADs and SBs have been accomplished before an aircraft is recertified.\\n\\n6. AD/SB Compliance and airworthiness review: The aircraft should undergo an airworthiness review either by a staff from EASA or a representative from an approved organization. If the airplane is found to comply with airworthiness requirements, the inspector will issue an airworthiness review certificate (ARC).\\n\\nRemember that the exact requirements can vary and this is a broad generalization. Always consult with an EASA expert or representative for specific cases.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"
